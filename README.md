# OpenGL_playground
For learning OpenGL with the help of https://learnopengl.com/. The project involves source code provided by the website. **My code is in src/*_demo.cpp and shaders/. This project is in it's early stages, more demos will come.**

**ONLY FOR CODE BROWSING/VIEWING, THIS REPO DOESN'T INVOLVE ALL DEPENDENCIES FOR BUILDING IT YOURSELF**

# First demo

Involves camera movement, perspective projection, texture mixing, rotating objects randomly.

# Second demo

Phong shading implemented. Next up probably lighting with base color maps and specular maps.
