# About
Meadow is an interactive graphics software, it is an ongoing personal project for learning purposes.

# Features
- Original rendering engine, which uses OpenGL.
- Synchronous event system to handle input envents.
- Assets such as 3D models can be in various formats, and textures as well.
- Primitive shapes (cubes and spheres) can be generated.
- Basic mesh transformation
- Basic, flexible material system
- Point lights and directional lights
- FPS camera

# In the future
- Cool shaders using normal maps and such
- Opaque objects
- Shadows
- Basic collision and physics simulation
- Object selection by clicking an object in the 3D world
- Object highlighting, selection
